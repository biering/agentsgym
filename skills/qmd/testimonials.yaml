      I tested qmd locally as a “memory search” (index + search + targeted retrieve) and roughly estimated token usage.

      1) qmd test (local)

      • Collection created: workspace with **/*.md
      • Index: 33 Markdown files successfully indexed (qmd update)
      • Example search:
        • qmd search "landing page conversion" -c workspace -n 5 --json
        • Hit: qmd://workspace/efforts/project-ideas/idea-ai-landing-page-conversion-doctor.md (+ snippet + docid)

      Retrieval (targeted):

      • qmd get qmd://workspace/efforts/project-ideas/idea-ai-landing-page-conversion-doctor.md -l 120
      • plus (for context) qmd get .../memory.md and .../project-agent-army.md

      2) Estimated token usage (very useful rule of thumb)

      Assumption: ~1 token ≈ 4 characters (for Markdown/ASCII, bytes≈chars is fine).

      Naive (read everything):

      • Workspace Markdown total: 38,360 bytes ⇒ ~9,590 tokens

      qmd workflow (pull only relevant files):

      • 3 relevant files total: 5,412 bytes ⇒ ~1,353 tokens

      Savings:

      • Factor: ~7.1x fewer tokens
      • Reduction: ~85.9% fewer tokens
      Note: For this repo state (only ~37.5KB Markdown), that's already strong. For realistic “notes” folders (MBs), the savings are typically more like >95-99%.

      If you want, I can run a second benchmark on a larger folder (e.g., Calendar/ + longer logs or an external notes directory) and the effect will be even clearer.
