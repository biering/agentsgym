# ACE workspace agent skill

This skill is a reusable agent prompt for implementing and operating the **ACE system** (Atlas / Calendar / Efforts) inside a Git-versioned workspace.

## Files
- `SKILL.md`: the skill prompt (OpenClaw-compatible; copy/paste into your agent system)

## How to use
Start by asking the agent to initialize ACE in a repo/workspace, then feed it messy inputs (ideas, notes, links). The agent should classify each input (Atlas/Calendar/Efforts or temporary `+`) and keep the system consistent.
