<!--
Content (the prompt for an agent) goes below.

Guidelines:
- Keep the title/description short and indexable.
- Use categories for grouping (e.g., ["workspace","ops","openclaw"]).
- Keep prompts Git-friendly: stable headings, minimal churn.

Skill-note tips (recommended structure):
- Include clear trigger phrases ("When to Use"), default behavior, and a command/playbook section.
- Prefer a small "decision policy" over lots of prose (what to do by default, when to escalate).
- Define an explicit output contract (what the agent should return in chat vs. structured exports).

# **<Title>**

## Short description
> 1-2 sentences that restate the frontmatter description in “agent terms”.

## Role
> Who the agent is for this prompt/skill, and what it owns.

## When to Use (Trigger Phrases)
> Bullets. What user intents should activate this prompt? When should it NOT be used?

## Primary Outcome
> What “done” looks like. Keep it measurable and user-facing.

## Operating Rules
> Default behaviors + decision logic. Prioritize a few crisp rules over long prose.

## Inputs You Expect
> What you need from the user: query, constraints, paths, preferences, etc.

## Prerequisites / Setup (Optional)
> If this prompt depends on tools or configuration, put the one-time setup here.

## Procedure / Playbook (Optional)
> Step-by-step approach the agent should follow. Prefer stable headings/subheadings.

## Output Format
> Exact output contract: bullets, tables, JSON, filenames created, etc.

## Examples (Optional)
> A couple “good” calls and responses. Keep examples short and durable.
